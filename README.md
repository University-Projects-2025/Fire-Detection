# Automatic Fire and Smoke Detection System
"Practical Machine Learning and Deep Learning" and "Introduction to Computer Vision" Course Project (Fall 2025)

Contributors: Lev Permiakov, Arina Petuhova, Aleliya Turushkina

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automatic detection system for identifying fire and smoke in images using a Deep Learning approach. The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify images into three distinct categories: Fire, Smoke, and No Threat.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
- Libraries for data processing: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- Visualization: Matplotlib

## Data
A public dataset containing labeled images with fire, smoke, normal (or no_fire) classes will be used for training and evaluating the model. 

The dataset will be divided into training, validation, and test samples.
